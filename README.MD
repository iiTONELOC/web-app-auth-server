# Web App Authentication Server

## _Coming Soon_

---

The Web App Authentication Server is written in C#, securely authenticates users for any connected application, and uses JSON Web Tokens for claim and session management. While this project can be reused, it is purposefully created to act as an authentication microservice for my projects and personal applications.
